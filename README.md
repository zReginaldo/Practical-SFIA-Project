# Introduction 
## Project Breif
* The general outline of this project was to use concepts from previous training modules such as, **Software Development with Python**, **Continuous Intergration** and **Cloud Fundamentals** to create a micro-service orientated architecture for an application. 

* This application had to be composed of at least 4 services that work together, two services that would generate a **random** object, the following service will create another object based on the results of the two services using logic, and lastly the final service will be responsible for communicating with the other 3 services, and finally for persisting some data in an SQL database.
